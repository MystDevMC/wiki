# Fluid Mixing <DataDriven >Check out `recicropal/mixing` to configure this behavior.</DataDriven>

[Gourd bottle](/recicropal/crops/bottle_gourd#gourd-bottles) blocks allow different fluids to be mixed when inserted.
How gourd bottles process fluid inserted to them can be described as follows.

```
</div>

Currently, only gourd bottle blocks support fluid mixing.

By default, potion fluids and [potion mixtures](#potion-mixing) can be mixed with one another.
Additionally, when mixed with milk, the milk will neutralize these fluids and turning them into plain old water.

## Potion Mixing <Configurable >Enable this via the `potionMixing` field config under the `bottle_gourd` category.</Configurable>

**Potions** can be mixed together inside a gourd bottle block, resulting in a potion mixture.
A bottle of potion in vanilla contains an amount of **potion** fluid with one or many potion **effects**.

### Mixture Fluids
Potion mixtures allow different **potions** to be drunk at the same time.
A mixture could be a **Potent Mix**, a **Sus Juice**, or an **Icky Sludge** depending on the potion effect types they contain.
Their color also changes based on the composition of potions inside them.

### Molarity
The proportions of **potions** inside a mixture are based on real-world concept of molarity.
A full `1` Molar potion in a `1` bucket mixture means that **the whole** mixture consists of that particular potion.
As another example, a `0.25 Molar` potion in a `1` bucket mixture means that **only 25%** of the whole mixture is that potion.

The **effects** inside a **potion** inside a mixture shares the same molarity.
The molarities of similar **effects** with the same amplifier from different **potions** will be combined when they are going to be applied to the player.

### Dosage
The lengths of potion effects applied are scaled based on the potion's molarity.
To apply the same effects and durations of a regular potion, the player needs to drink `250 moles`

Configure this via the `drinkingMaxAmount` field config under the `bottle_gourd` category.
</Configurable>_
`(250 mB * 1 Molar)` worth of that potion.

For example, mixing a 3-minute strength and 3-minute invisibility potions would result in each of them having 0.5 molarity in the mixture.
Drinking 250 mB from the mixture would apply 1.5-minute worth of both potions.

Potion fluids are considered to have a 1 Molar of their respective **potions**.

Different types of potions also modify the resulting length of each drink. This includes splash and lingering potions.
They only apply the bonus durations when mixed. Drinking splash and lingering potions on their own from the bottle
would be the same as drinking their regular counterparts.

### Splash Potions
Splash **potions** averages the durations of all **effects** added to the mix. This averaging effect is controlled by the molarity too.
The more splash **potions** are inside the mixture, the more well-distributed the durations of **effects** become.

The formula used to calculate the resulting length of an **effect** after considering splash potions can be described as following.

<div className="flex justify-center">
```
len = (avgLen * splashM + oldLen * nonSplashM) * effectM
```
</div>

As an example, a `3`-minute **splash** fire resistance (250 mB) mixed with a **normal** `8`-minute water breathing (250 mB) will result in 
a 500 mB mixture that applies...
- A `(3+8)/(2) * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5 = 4.25 * 250/500 = 2.125`-minute fire resistance, and...
- A `(3+8)/(2) * 0.5 + 8 * 0.5 = 6.75 * 250/500 = 3.375`-minute water breathing
per 250 mB drunk.

In contrast, a `3`-minute **splash** fire resistance (250 mB) mixed with an `8`-minute **splash** water breathing (250 mB) will result in
a 500 mB mixture that applies `(3+8)/(2) * 1 + 0 = 5.5 * 0.5 = 2.25`-minute of each potion effects per 250 mB drunk.

### Lingering Potions
Lingering potions extends the duration of applied effects per drinking depending on their proportions in the mix.
The more lingering potion is in the mix, the longer the duration of each effects per drink become.
The maximum length can be achieved here is twice the effect's length. This happens when 100% of the potions in the mix were all lingering.

<div className="flex justify-center">
```
finalLen = lenAfterSplash * (1 + lingeringM)
```
</div>

### Instantaneous Effects
Some effects are Instantaneous, meaning their duration are meaningless since they are applied instantly.
When drinking a mixture that has Instantaneous effects, the moles drunk would be tallied until it reaches the proper [dosage](#dosage) inside the player's body.

For instance, the player needs to drink 1000 mBs worth of mixture that has 25% instant healing in order to receive the healing.

The effects with the same type and amplifier from different drinks would be tallied together.

The player would lose previously accumulated moles when they die.

## Recipes

To allow other fluids to be mixed, `recicropal:mixing` recipes could be configured.
Their structure can be described as following.
