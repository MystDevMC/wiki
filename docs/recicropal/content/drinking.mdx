[Gourd bottles](/recicropal/crops/bottle_gourd#gourd-bottles) allow the player to drink the fluids they contain.

By default, the maximum amount of fluid consumed per drinking is 250 mB which is generally one serving of a bottle.

Configure this via the `drinkingMaxAmount` field config under the `bottle_gourd` category.

[Milk, honey, and potion fluids](/recicropal/crops/bottle_gourd#milk-honey-and-potion-fluid) are by default
configured to be drinkable from gourd bottles.
Drinking milk would clear the status effects applied to the player.
Drinking honey would restore the same amount of hunger like honey bottles and also clears the poison status effect.
Drinking potion fluids would apply the aforementioned potion's effects to the player.

Water can also be drunk from gourd bottles. Drinking water from gourd bottles is equal to drinking vanilla water bottles.

[Potion mixtures](/recicropal/content/mixing#potion-mixing) would apply it's potion effects to the player when drunk.
The durations of the potion effects applied are proportional to their *molarity* inside the mixture.
Read the linked article for more info on potion mixing.

## Recipes

To make other fluids drinkable, `recicropal:drinking` recipes could be configured.
Their structure can be described as following.

<JsonStructure title="Drinking Recipe">
  <JsonNode content={<><JsonDataType type="string"/> <code>type</code> : <code>recicropal:drinking</code></>}/>
  <JsonNode content={<><JsonDataType type="array"/> <code>conditions</code> Predicates to achieve conditionally-loaded data.</>}/>
  <JsonNode content={<><JsonDataType type="obj"/> <code>fluid</code> A fluid definition to match for drinking.</>}>
    <JsonNode content={<>Either a <code>tag</code> or <code>fluid</code> but not both.</>}>
      <JsonNode content={<><JsonDataType type="string"/> <code>tag</code> A fluid tag to match.</>}/>
      <JsonNode content={<><JsonDataType type="string"/> <code>fluid</code> A fluid ID.</>}/>
    </JsonNode>
    <JsonNode content={<><JsonDataType type="obj"/> <code>nbt</code> An optional NBT structured as-is. If this is specified, the recipe would sensitively match for the NBT. If not, the recipe woould ignore the fluid's NBTs.</>}/>
  </JsonNode>
  <JsonNode content={<><JsonDataType type="int"/> <code>amount</code> The amount of fluid to be drunk. If not specified, the recipe would allow drinking the fluid with any number between 0 and the configured <code>drinkingMaxAmount</code>, which is 250 by default.</>}/>
  <JsonNode content={<><JsonDataType type="array"/> <code>results</code> A list of <code>drink_result_type</code>s. See below for further info.</>}>
      <JsonNode content={<><JsonDataType type="string"/> <code>type</code> The ID of the type.</>}/>
      <JsonNode content={<>Other arbitrary properties each type may require.</>}/>
  </JsonNode>
</JsonStructure>

`drink_result_type`s are in-game effects that would trigger when fluids are drunk.
Currently, there are 6 `drink_result_types` available:
- `recicropal:finish_item` would trigger effects of an `item` when that item is used.
- `recicropal:finish_item_transfer_nbt` would trigger effects of an `item` when that item is used with the NBT from the fluid drunk transferred to the item.
Its main use case is for handling potion fluids.
- `recicropal:mixture` would trigger the effects of [potion mixtures](/recicropal/content/mixing#potion-mixing) when they drunk. It is not meant to be used for other fluids.
- `recicropal:heal`, `recicropal:set_fire`, and `recicropal:zap` trigger what their names suggest and are all meant for debugging purposes only.
They may be removed in upcoming updates.
