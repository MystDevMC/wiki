# Integrations

`recicropal` is meant to be enjoyed alongside other mods so integrations are necessary.

## `sereneseasons`

[Bottle gourds](/recicropal/crops/bottle_gourd) and [climbing melons and pumpkins](/recicropal/crops/climbing_crops) crops have their own configured growing seasons.
_<DataDriven >
Check out `sereneseasons/tags` in the `data` folder that comes with `recicropal`
</DataDriven>_
Bottle gourds would only grow in the spring. Climbing melons in the summer. And climbing pumpkins in the autumn.

## `create`

If `create` exists, all `#forge:honey` fluids would be converted into `create`'s honey when inserted into a [gourd bottle](/recicropal/crops/bottle_gourd#gourd-bottles).
_<DataDriven >
This is a personal preference and can be opted-out by disabling the `ingress_honey.json` recipe in the `data/recipes/compat/create` folder that comes with `recicropal`
</DataDriven>_
This may cause complications if the packdev wants to preserve other kinds of honey.

`create`'s potion fluids will be converted into `recicropal`'s potion fluid when inserted into a [gourd bottle](/recicropal/crops/bottle_gourd#gourd-bottles).
This is done under the hood by renaming the tag `Bottle` inside the fluid into `Modifier` and changing the fluid types.
_<DataDriven >
This can be configured via the `ingress_potion.json` recipe in the `data/recipes/compat/create` folder that comes with `recicropal`
</DataDriven>_

## `farmersdelight` <DataDriven >This can be configured in the `data/recipes/compat/farmersdelight` folder that comes with `recicropal`</DataDriven>
`farmersdelight`'s milk bottles can be used for interacting with [gourd bottles](/recicropal/crops/bottle_gourd#gourd-bottles).
Similarly, glass bottles can be used to pour out milk from gourd bottles.
If this mod exists, milk drinking would also follow the rules of milk bottle drinking which only clears one status effect.

## `cofh_core` <DataDriven >This can be configured via the `ingress_potion.json` in the `data/recipes/compat/cofh_core` folder that comes with `recicropal`</DataDriven>
To support the potion fluids from `thermal` series, `cofh_core`'s potion fluids will be converted into `recicropal`'s potion fluid when inserted into a [gourd bottle](/recicropal/crops/bottle_gourd#gourd-bottles).
This is done under the hood by adding the tag `Modifier: "normal"` to the fluid NBT and changing the fluid types.

## `thermal` <DataDriven >This can be configured in the `data/recipes/compat/thermal` folder that comes with `recicropal`</DataDriven>
`thermal`'s syrup bottles can be used for interacting with [gourd bottles](/recicropal/crops/bottle_gourd#gourd-bottles).
Similarly, glass bottles can be used to pour out syrup from gourd bottles.
Syrup can be drunk, triggering the effects of drinking a syrup bottle when so.
